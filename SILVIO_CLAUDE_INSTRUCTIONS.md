Hi Claude,

I need your help with my Be Well patient intake workflow. I have a FormAssembly BioSync intake form that patients fill out, and I need to process their submissions to create personalized wellness portals.

Here's my current system:
- FormAssembly form URL: https://www.tfaforms.com/5180217
- Admin dashboard: [my-netlify-site]/admin.html
- Portal system: Be Well BioSync Portal on Netlify

When a patient submits the intake form on FormAssembly, I need to:

1. Get their form data (patient name, email, health information)
2. Generate personalized wellness recommendations based on their responses
3. Create an HTML portal with their customized wellness plan
4. Deploy it to Netlify as a unique patient portal

Can you help me process a new patient intake? I'll provide you with:
- The patient's form responses from FormAssembly
- Any additional context about their health goals

I need you to:
1. Analyze their intake information
2. Generate personalized wellness recommendations including:
   - Nutrition guidance
   - Movement/exercise plans
   - Mindfulness practices
   - Supplement recommendations
   - Lifestyle modifications
3. Create the HTML code for their patient portal that includes:
   - Their name throughout the portal
   - Personalized wellness score
   - Specific recommendations based on their intake
   - Next steps for their wellness journey

The HTML should follow this structure:
- Beautiful, professional design
- Mobile-responsive
- Includes their personalized data
- Ready to paste and deploy

My mission is to help every human being on Earth Be Well, and your analysis helps me create truly personalized care plans for each patient.

Please generate the complete HTML portal code that I can deploy immediately.
